# Memory Card Matching Game

## Description

This project is a simple Memory Card Matching Game implemented using vanilla JavaScript. Flip cards to find matching pairs, practice interacting with the DOM, select elements, add event listeners, and randomize arrays.

## How to Play

1. Start with a grid of cards, each displaying a cover image.
2. Click a card to reveal its hidden image.
3. Find matching pairs by clicking two cards consecutively.
4. Matched cards stay open; unmatched cards flip back.
5. Continue until all pairs are found.
6. The game ends with a congratulations message.

## Features

- Random card arrangement for a unique challenge.
- Track matched pairs displayed on the screen.
- Congratulations message when all pairs are matched.

## Usage

```sh

## Enhancements and Learning

### Practice:

- Interacting with the DOM and element manipulation.
- Selecting queries and adding event listeners.
- Randomly sorting arrays of images for a shuffled card grid.
- Implementing a simple matching mechanism.
- Debugging code to improve functionality.
- Experimenting with code formatting and linting using Prettier.
- Feel free to add features, customize the design, or refactor the code for further enhancements.

### Happy coding! ðŸ˜„
